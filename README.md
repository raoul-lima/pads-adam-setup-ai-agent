# ADAM Setup AI Agent

## 📋 Project Summary

**ADAM** (Advertising Data Analysis & Management) is an AI-powered assistant that helps advertising professionals analyze campaigns, detect setup issues, and automate tasks across major advertising platforms like Google DV360, Amazon Advertising, and Microsoft Advertising.

## 🎯 What Does ADAM Do?

ADAM acts as an intelligent assistant for advertising campaign managers. Users can:

- **Ask Questions**: "How many line items do I have?" or "Check for anomalies in Campaign X"
- **Get Analysis**: ADAM analyzes campaign data and provides insights
- **Detect Issues**: Automatically finds setup problems, budget issues, or configuration errors
- **Generate Reports**: Creates downloadable CSV reports with analysis results
- **Learn from Feedback**: Improves over time based on user feedback

## 💼 Business Value

- **Time Savings**: Reduces manual analysis time from hours to minutes
- **Error Detection**: Automatically finds campaign setup issues before they cause problems
- **Consistency**: Provides standardized analysis across all campaigns
- **Multi-language**: Supports teams in English, French, Spanish, Dutch, and Polish
- **Scalability**: Handles analysis for multiple partners and users simultaneously
